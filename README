pika yfncc configuration management
-----------------------------------

This repository contains the configuration files for all yfncc-managed
computers at pika. This repository is public, but edited only in coordination
with yfncc.

The "midstream" branch contains scripts that may be of independent interest,
the pika branch is exclusively for stuff concerning specific computers.

This repository is rebased onto the latest cdist release every once in a while
as follows:

	git fetch https://github.com/telmich/cdist.git
	git checkout midstream && git rebase 4.3.1 # pick your release
	# resolve conflicts here
	git chcekout pika && git rebase midstream

To keep this working cleanly, it is important not to modify unrelated files in
the same commit, and it may make sense to squash revert commites before rebase.


cdist
-----

cdist is a usable configuration management system.
