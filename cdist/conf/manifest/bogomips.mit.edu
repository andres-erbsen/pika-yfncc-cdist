# bogomips.mit.edu is a 2U server with 12 drive bays. It is used for backups
# and other storage. This configuration file manages the operating system which
# is installed on a USB disk.
#
# The state of the drives is managed manually. By this we mean that the SUN
# RAID controller to which the drives are connected is holding the drives
# hostage and every time we want to add, remove, or replace a drive we need to
# press C-A during boot and wrangle the controller's archaic interface. No
# hot-plug for you :/. As an extra feature, the default way of adding a new
# drive overwrites its partition table.
#
# Of course, we do not actually use the hardware RAID controller for RAID. Both
# the 6x2TB (in slots 0..5) and 6x1TB (in slots 6..11) arrays will be set up in
# a raidz2 configuration, able to tolerate two disk failures even amid power
# failures and providing 4x2=8TB and 4x1=4TB storage respectively.
#
# The zpool containting the 6 2TB drives on the (technician's) left when facing
# the server from its front is called "left". It has two filesystems:
# /left/media and /left/archive.
#
# The state of the dirves can be viewed by running "zpool status", detailed
# information can be seen using "zfs get all".
